# Networking

This guide covers the operator's networking features: Aerospike network access policies, automatic Kubernetes NetworkPolicy generation, CNI bandwidth shaping, external seed discovery via LoadBalancer, and custom service metadata.

## AerospikeNetworkPolicy

`spec.aerospikeNetworkPolicy` controls how Aerospike advertises its addresses to clients and peer nodes. This is critical for hybrid environments where clients connect from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

### Access Types

Each field accepts one of four values:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `pod` | Use the Pod IP (default). Best for in-cluster clients. |
| `hostInternal` | Use the Kubernetes node's internal IP. For clients on the same private network. |
| `hostExternal` | Use the Kubernetes node's external IP. For clients outside the cloud VPC. |
| `configuredIP` | Use a custom IP from pod annotations. For advanced multi-network setups (e.g., Multus). |

### Fields

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `accessType` | `pod` | How clients reach the Aerospike service port (3000). |
| `alternateAccessType` | `pod` | How clients from alternate networks reach the service port. |
| `fabricType` | `pod` | How Aerospike nodes communicate with each other (fabric/heartbeat). |

### Example: In-Cluster Only (Default)

```yaml
apiVersion: acko.io/v1alpha1
kind: AerospikeCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  namespace: aerospike
spec:
  size: 3
  image: aerospike:ce-8.1.1.1
  aerospikeNetworkPolicy:
    accessType: pod
    fabricType: pod
```

### Example: External Client Access via Host Network

When clients connect from outside the cluster, advertise the node's external IP:

```yaml
spec:
  aerospikeNetworkPolicy:
    accessType: hostExternal
    alternateAccessType: hostInternal
    fabricType: pod
```

In this setup:
- External clients connect using the node's external IP.
- Internal clients (alternate network) use the node's internal IP.
- Inter-node fabric traffic stays on the pod network for performance.

### Example: ConfiguredIP with Custom Network Names

For environments using secondary network interfaces (e.g., Multus CNI), use `configuredIP` with custom network names. The operator reads the IP from the pod's `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status` annotation matching the specified network name.

```yaml
spec:
  aerospikeNetworkPolicy:
    accessType: configuredIP
    customAccessNetworkNames:
      - "aerospike-sriov-network"
    alternateAccessType: configuredIP
    customAlternateAccessNetworkNames:
      - "aerospike-macvlan-network"
    fabricType: configuredIP
    customFabricNetworkNames:
      - "aerospike-sriov-network"
```

:::warning
When using `configuredIP`, you must provide the corresponding `custom*NetworkNames` field. The operator will fail to resolve the IP if the network name does not match an entry in the pod's network-status annotation.
:::

## NetworkPolicyConfig

`spec.networkPolicyConfig` enables automatic creation of Kubernetes NetworkPolicy or Cilium CiliumNetworkPolicy resources. This restricts network traffic to only what the Aerospike cluster needs.

### Generated Rules

When enabled, the operator creates a NetworkPolicy with these ingress rules:

1. **Intra-cluster traffic**: Fabric (3001) and heartbeat (3002) ports are allowed only from pods matching the cluster's selector labels.
2. **Client access**: Service port (3000) is open to all sources.
3. **Metrics** (if monitoring is enabled): The configured metrics port is open to all sources for Prometheus scraping.

### Standard Kubernetes NetworkPolicy

```yaml
spec:
  networkPolicyConfig:
    enabled: true
    type: kubernetes
```

### Cilium CiliumNetworkPolicy

If your cluster uses Cilium as the CNI, you can generate a `CiliumNetworkPolicy` instead:

```yaml
spec:
  networkPolicyConfig:
    enabled: true
    type: cilium
```

:::info
If the CiliumNetworkPolicy CRD is not installed in the cluster, the operator logs a message and skips creation gracefully. No error is raised.
:::

### Disabling

Set `enabled: false` (or remove the field entirely) to delete any previously created NetworkPolicy:

```yaml
spec:
  networkPolicyConfig:
    enabled: false
```

## BandwidthConfig

`spec.bandwidthConfig` injects CNI bandwidth annotations on pod templates for traffic shaping. This is useful for limiting network throughput per pod to prevent noisy-neighbor issues in shared clusters.

The operator sets the standard `kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth` and `kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth` annotations, which are recognized by CNI plugins such as the Cilium bandwidth manager and the bandwidth CNI plugin.

### Example

```yaml
spec:
  bandwidthConfig:
    ingress: "1Gbps"
    egress: "500Mbps"
```

Both fields are optional. You can set only ingress, only egress, or both:

```yaml
spec:
  bandwidthConfig:
    egress: "200Mbps"
```

:::note
Bandwidth shaping requires a CNI plugin that supports these annotations. If your CNI does not support them, the annotations are ignored.
:::

## SeedsFinderServices

`spec.seedsFinderServices` creates a LoadBalancer service for external seed discovery. This allows clients outside the Kubernetes cluster to discover Aerospike seed nodes via the LoadBalancer's external IP.

### LoadBalancer Configuration

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `annotations` | — | Custom annotations on the LoadBalancer service (e.g., for cloud provider configuration). |
| `labels` | — | Custom labels on the LoadBalancer service. |
| `externalTrafficPolicy` | — | `Cluster` or `Local`. Use `Local` to preserve client source IP. |
| `port` | `3000` | External port on the LoadBalancer. |
| `targetPort` | `3000` | Container port to forward traffic to. |
| `loadBalancerSourceRanges` | — | Restrict traffic to specific CIDRs for security. |

### Example: Basic LoadBalancer

```yaml
spec:
  seedsFinderServices:
    loadBalancer:
      port: 3000
```

### Example: Production LoadBalancer with Restrictions

```yaml
spec:
  seedsFinderServices:
    loadBalancer:
      port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
      externalTrafficPolicy: Local
      loadBalancerSourceRanges:
        - "10.0.0.0/8"
        - "172.16.0.0/12"
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-scheme: "internal"
      labels:
        environment: production
```

## HeadlessService

`spec.headlessService` allows you to attach custom annotations and labels to the headless service that the operator creates for each cluster. The headless service (named `<cluster-name>-headless`) enables DNS-based pod discovery and is always created.

### Example

```yaml
spec:
  headlessService:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
        external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: "aerospike.example.com"
      labels:
        team: platform
```

:::note
Operator-managed labels (e.g., `app.kubernetes.io/name`, `app.kubernetes.io/instance`) cannot be overridden by custom labels. If you specify a label key that conflicts with an operator-managed key, the operator's value takes precedence.
:::

## PodService

`spec.podService` creates an individual ClusterIP Service for each Aerospike pod. This is useful when you need stable, per-pod DNS names or when integrating with service meshes that require individual service endpoints.

When configured, the operator creates a Service named `<pod-name>-pod` for each pod, selecting that specific pod via `statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name`.

### Example

```yaml
spec:
  podService:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: "nlb"
      labels:
        visibility: external
```

The operator automatically cleans up stale pod services after scale-down or when `podService` is removed from the spec.
