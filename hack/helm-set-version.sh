# helm-set-version.sh: Set the in-repo Helm chart version to VERSION.
#
# The chart version, the chart appVersion (which is what the operator image tag
# falls through to when values.image.tag is empty), the CRD sub-chart version and
# the dependency pin in the umbrella chart all have to move together. Bumping
# only some of them is how the chart ended up rendering a 1.3.1 operator image
# while the release was 1.10.x (#347), so this script moves all of them at once
# and regenerates Chart.lock plus the vendored sub-chart .tgz.
#
# Usage:
#   hack/helm-set-version.sh 1.10.3
#   hack/helm-set-version.sh v1.10.3     # leading v is stripped
#   hack/helm-set-version.sh --print-files
#
# --print-files prints, one per line, every repo-root-relative path this script
# rewrites, and changes nothing. .github/workflows/daily-release.yml stages that
# list after a bump: it used to hard-code `git add charts/`, which dropped the
# chart pin this script also rewrites in the translated install guide and left
# `make helm-check-version` red on main after every auto-bump.
