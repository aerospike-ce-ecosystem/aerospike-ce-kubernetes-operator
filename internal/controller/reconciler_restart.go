// unreachable node is recorded with a positive sentinel rather than dropped
// (aero_info.go). The scale-down path preserves that caution and treats a check
// error as "migrating". The rolling restart used to discard it and delete the
// next batch anyway, which is exactly backwards: the window in which the cluster
// is least reachable is a rolling restart, so the fail-open branch fired when it
// was most dangerous (#341).
//
// The restart path does have one thing scale-down does not: a restart can be the
// remedy. If a bad config left every pod crash-looping, the cluster is
// unreachable *because* of the thing the restart would fix, and blocking forever
// is its own outage. So the gate fails closed with a bounded escape hatch rather
// than unconditionally.
//
// State is in-memory rather than in status on purpose. It is a debounce, not a
// fact about the cluster, and losing it is safe in the direction that matters:
// an operator restart resets the counter, so the gate returns to fail-closed and
// the clock starts again. Leader election means only one replica reconciles a
